1. Program Purpose and Function
- The purpose of the program is to provide a platform in which users can schedule and plan out their day, as well as take into account their mindfulness and mental health.
2. Data Abstraction
- Information such as ratings and scales will be stored in lists, which demonstrates data abstraction.
3. Managing Complexity
- The list will have to contain the items to display.
4. Procedural Abstraction
- The procedures will involve creating events or tasks, or creating journal entries.
5. Algorithm Implementation
- Looping through days and months and years will require algorithm implementation.
6. Testing
- There can be functions such as "overview of your week" that need to call different values from different places.
